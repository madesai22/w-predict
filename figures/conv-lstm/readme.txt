You should be able to run these visualizations by typing â€˜tensorboard --logdir <name of directory>', then copying and pasting the link into your browser. Usually the link is http://<name of your machine>.lan:6006

Example:
tensorboard --logdir 3-13

Then in my browser: http://educ-lap-361.lan:6006
